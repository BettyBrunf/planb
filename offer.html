			<p class="offer"><u>Working with us?</u><br>Our ground rules are people who pay and reply on time, we like working efficiently and respectfully. We appreciate people who understand that design is a process that demands consideration and time. We want to work with you, not for you by approaching projects with flexibility and adapting to your needs. It is in our best interest to create an outcome that pushes your brand and project to where you want it to be. We prefer working from the beginning of the conceptualisation right to the end of the delivery. So if you’re interested, drop us an email for a free consultation to discuss your project.</p><br>

			<p class="offer">Our free <b>50 minute consultation</b> would take the form of an informal discussion where we would act as an external graphic design auditor prompting the following key points and questions:<br><br>
				<ul class="consult">
					<li>Initial thoughts on your existing brand/project presence (i.e. Where is your brand/project positioned)</li>
					<li>Figuring out where you want to be positioned and where your priorities lie (i.e. What kind of interest do you want to attract?)</li>
					<li>What makes you stand out or how would you like to stand out? </li>
					<li>Potential design outcomes/assets/deliverables (i.e. Visual Identity, Signage, Brand Strategy, WebDesign etc.)</li> 
				</ul>
