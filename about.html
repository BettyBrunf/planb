			We (Baki and Betty) are Plan B, a two woman operation, we first met at the Royal College of Art in 2018 two years ago and ever since our first accidental pairing on a project we never stopped collaborating. Baki grew up in Germany and is of Pakistani descent and Betty is Belgian. </p>

			<p class="introparagraph">We think respect and tolerance are primordial and these are the values we approach our work with. We collaborate with a lot of creatives, writers, researchers in various industries and like to maintain a network that fuels lots of interesting ideas and conversations. Our professional experience includes working with clients in the sustainability sector, NGO’s, Cultural sectors, artists and socio-political engaged individuals.
